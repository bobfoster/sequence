/**
 * Sequence is an interface implemented by value providers.
 * 
 * <p>A provider implements the seq method, which accepts a receiver and returns
 * a value of the receiver value type. Unfortunately, a Sequence cannot be
 * implemented in Java except with a fixed type R, and the whole point is that a
 * receiver may compute a value of any type; hence the Object return. The
 * caller of seq must know the value type returned and cast it appropriately.
